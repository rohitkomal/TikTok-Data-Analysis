# TikTok Data Analysis

I will be working on Social Media data analysis using Python and *Requests*

# Steps to run the project

It is preferred to use a Python Virtual Environment when we try to run this project. Use the following command to setup and activate your Virtual Environment:

```
python3 -m venv env
. .env/bin/activate
```
