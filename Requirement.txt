Final Project - COVID-19 and its effect on the stock market (100 Marks)
You have been tasked with creating some visualizations and reporting on the effect of COVID-19 on the stock market.  You will use all of the concepts and skills you have learned so far in this course.  You may have a group of up to 3 participants to produce the solution to the final project.

Steps:
Set up a Git repository to allow you to collaborate on the Python solution
Read the daily confirmed cases and deaths into two dataframes can be found at this github page:
confirmed_cases_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv"
deaths_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv"
Use pandas to create a dataframe that aggregates and sums both confirmed cases and deaths on a global level
Research a stock for each below that reflects the following industries (it will be used in the next step):
Overall American Market
Overall Canadian Market
Travel sector
The Real Estate sector
Precious metals (Gold, Silver, Platinum, etc)
Use AlphaVantage (the stock API used earlier in the course) to get the daily high and low prices for your selected stocks
Append that info to the data frame created in step 3)
Create an appropriate graph detailing your info - explain why you chose the graphs you did, use matplotlib
 

Deliverables:
Git commit logs (20 Marks - you will want to do similar amounts of work, any showing of a high skew of work towards one group member may result in an according weighting of the overall mark!)
Python solution file(s) (60 Marks)
Generated visual output (20 Marks)
